description: Five water molecules forming a H-bonded complex just above a carbon nanotube
  tip. The HOMO is confined to the nanotube only. The presence of polar water molecules
  enhances field-emission current from nanotube tip. Calculations performed with MS
  Modeling's DMol3. (Image courtesy of Accelrys, www.accelrys.com.)
